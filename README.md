## Conference Attendence and/or Conference Grant
3. You can attend conferences as a volunteer without having a paper in them. That usually waives the registration fee and helps you get a good idea about the conference. For example check SIGGRAPH student volunteering: https://s2020.siggraph.org/submissions/student-volunteers-submissions
